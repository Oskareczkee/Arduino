# Snake For Arduino
Project made as an assignment job. It simulates Snake game in Arduino platform. Screen is build using NeoPixel LED Strips.  

## About Project
- Project was made in TinkerCad.  
- Bigger screen can be made, but TinkerCad does pretty badly in emulating all this electronic and its laggy, so I do not advise making screen bigger.  
- If you wish, you can build in real this project, then there should be no problem with lags.  
- Also whole program is just in 1 file, because i could not figure out how to add more files with code or it's just not possible in TinkerCad
