# LEDs
This is my own project. Once i bought programmable LED strip I decided to program it on my own.

## About Project
LEDs Itself are pretty much advanced. Simple commands are provided to change various parameters.
### Implemented Functions
- Linear Gradient
- Simple command interface
- Multiple lighting modes (gradient, static, police, Morse Code message)  

Sadly I cannot implement more modes due to memory limitations.
I do not have any scheme of electronics, so building this on our own is harder  

## Further Develompent
I develop this when I find my lighting boring, so this code will get updated
